## DSA Questions
### Author : Shubham Jain
This repo has DSA question solutions from different platforms. I'm creating such repo for consistency and make my familiar with git. In this i have set target to solve several question of one topic per week like:
* Week 1 : Two Pointer approach - 35 questions in 4 days (15-09-2025 to 18-09-2025)<br>

**Taking one week break due to exams in my university, will continue soon..**

* Week 2 : Binary Search
* Week 3 : Backtracking
* Week 4 : Linked List
* Week 5 : Stack and Queue
* Week 6 : Tree
* Week 7 : Graphs
* Week 8 : DP

> The order may change as many topics are interlinked. I'd try to maintain a record of my progress and where i stuck in questions.
